# Software-Development-Lifecycle
Projects from Software Development Lifecycle Class



I implemented users needs by reading the interviews and the user stories. The user stories are a breakdown of what they are looking for and helps in this process.

I used scrum values to develop this program. In the future I will like to use user stories and Agile estimation practices. I would also like to work in small teams so that open communication is easier. 

I believe open communication is key to being a good team member. I also believe that it is important to be self motivated and to take responsibility for oneâ€™s own mistakes.
